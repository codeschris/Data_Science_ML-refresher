# Data Science/Machine Learning Refresher

This is a repository I created so I can put my Statistics, Data Science and Machine learning knowledge on paper and practice on the go. I am a Statistics and Computer Science student and Statistics has been very interesting for me and so, I decided to follow that career path as I still work on my other developer skills.

## Languages I will be using:
- Python
- Javascript
- R

## Tools
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook
